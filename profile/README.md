## What is Sandboxie-Plus?

**Sandboxie-Plus** is a powerful and modern open-source sandboxing application for Windows that allows users to run applications in an isolated virtual environment. This prevents any changes made by the software—such as installations, downloads, or system modifications—from affecting the actual operating system. Originally based on the classic Sandboxie, Sandboxie-Plus includes enhanced features, improved compatibility, and ongoing community-driven development.

With Sandboxie-Plus, you can safely test untrusted software, browse the web without risk, and run potentially harmful applications without compromising your system. It is widely used by developers, IT professionals, security researchers, and privacy-conscious users.

Sandboxie-Plus supports all modern versions of Windows and offers both a user-friendly interface and advanced configuration options for power users. Its lightweight design ensures that sandboxed applications run smoothly without significant performance overhead.
